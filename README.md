🦘 Australia Zoo  — Team Project
This website was created as part of our Front-End course assignment at Future Games.
The goal of the project was to design and develop a responsive website for an Australian zoo, while applying the fundamentals of:

⦁	  Project planning
⦁	
⦁	  SCRUM & teamwork
⦁	
⦁	  JavaScript basics
⦁	
⦁	  HTML/CSS structure
⦁	
⦁	  Git & GitHub version control

We worked in a development team, shared responsibilities, tracked tasks on a Scrum board, and reviewed each other's code throughout the project.
Our team successfully built all required pages, handled merge conflicts, tested features, and maintained both a development and production environment.

🐾 Project Requirements

The website had to include information about a minimum of 9 animals from 3 different groups (Mammals, Birds, Reptiles).
The website consists of the following pages:

🌿 Common Layout for All Pages
